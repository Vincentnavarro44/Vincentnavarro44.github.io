### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    I chose lab 1 because this was the first computer science lab I ever did. It was by far the easiest of the labs, but the most helpful. In this lab, I learned the basics of coding which was how to use std::cout/cin.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5 was a very important lab for me, because I learned a lot in this lab. My partner was kind enough to explain what everything meant throughtout the lab, which was very helpful. In this lab we learned how to caulate the area of a rectangle, as well as how to use cin, cout, and initializing variables.

* Lab 10
    This lab was a very interesting and "fun" lab. My partner and I worked very well together. In this lab we learned how to use std::vector to go through our code and find the population of different counties in California.
